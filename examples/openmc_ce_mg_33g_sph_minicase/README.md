# OpenMC CE/MG SPH Colorset Minicase

This is a reduced transport and handoff diagnostic for the OpenMC-side SPH
machinery:

```text
OpenMC continuous-energy reference
  + OpenMC multi-group macro calculation
    using the selected energy mesh on the same test partition
  -> diagnostic flux-target SPH factors
  -> corrected MGXS HDF5 / SPH sidecar
  -> openmc2donjon L_MACROLIB ASCII for DONJON SPH consumption
```

It deliberately does **not** use a DONJON feedback loop. DONJON is only the
downstream consumer of the corrected handoff. This minicase also deliberately
keeps the CE and MG spatial partition identical, so it tests the numerical
loop and data handoff; it is not the standard physical homogenization claim.

The standard physical route uses a detailed heterogeneous OpenMC CE reference
geometry and a homogenized OpenMC MG coarse geometry. Their energy groups,
state, boundary conditions, and comparison-domain mapping must be compatible;
their geometric detail is intentionally different.

## Geometry

The default model is a tiny three-region slab colorset with reflective outer
boundaries:

```text
CS_FUEL  -> DONJON mixture 1 / SPH region 1
CS_MOD   -> DONJON mixture 2 / SPH region 2
CS_ABS   -> DONJON mixture 3 / SPH region 3
```

This remains the default because it runs quickly and is useful as a
development smoke.  A minimal two-region colorset is also available for the
Alain/Siggi case where two output regions require two `SPH(region, group)`
factors per energy group:

```sh
OPENMC2DONJON_COLORSET_VARIANT=two_region \
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_two_region \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

```text
CS_FUEL -> fuel-like output region
CS_MOD  -> moderator-like output region
```

A larger five-region two-dimensional variant is available for the next physics
validation step:

```sh
OPENMC2DONJON_COLORSET_VARIANT=five_region_2d \
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_five_region_2d \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

The five-region variant uses the same diagnostic CE/MG/SPH loop, but exports five
OpenMC cell domains instead of three:

```text
CS_FUEL_L -> fuel-like output region
CS_MOD    -> moderator-like output region
CS_FUEL_U -> second fuel-like output region
CS_ABS    -> absorber/control-like output region
CS_REF    -> reflector-like output region
```

Use `two_region` to demonstrate the minimum multi-region SPH mechanics. Use
the three-region variant for fast interface checks.  Use `five_region_2d` when
reviewing the behavior of a larger same-partition low-order diagnostic.

This concrete minicase uses the ECCO-33 energy mesh, but the workflow is not
limited to 33 groups: any valid OpenMC MG group structure can be used as long
as the CE-tallied MGXS handoff, OpenMC MG macro solve, CE flux export, and MG
flux export all share the same group boundaries and output-region ordering.

The converter-facing handoff uses Legendre order 3 so DONJON receives ordinary
P1/P2/P3 scatter moments.  The OpenMC MG macro calculation used to derive SPH
factors uses histogram angular representation by default (`H16`):

```text
CE statepoint tallies:
  P3 Legendre scatter -> converter MGXS HDF5
  H16 histogram scatter -> OpenMC MG macro solve
```

The H16 data is not written to DONJON as scatter data.  It is only used inside
OpenMC's MG run to obtain a higher-fidelity MG flux.  The final DONJON handoff
is:

```text
CE-tallied P3 MGXS + OpenMC-side SPH(region, group)
```

The SPH factors produced by this example are still scalar factors per region
and energy group:

```text
SPH(region, group)
```

## Run

Set `PYTHON_BIN` to the Python environment that can import both OpenMC and
openmc2donjon.  Set `OPENMC_EXEC` if `openmc` is not on `PATH`.

```sh
PYTHON_BIN=/Users/wen/miniforge3/envs/openmc-dev/bin/python \
OPENMC_EXEC=/Users/wen/openmc-workspace/src-v0.15.3/build/bin/openmc \
OPENMC_LIB_DIR=/Users/wen/openmc-workspace/src-v0.15.3/build/lib \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

Optional knobs:

```sh
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase
PARTICLES=1000 BATCHES=20 INACTIVE=5
MG_PARTICLES=1000 MG_BATCHES=20 MG_INACTIVE=5
MG_MACRO_SCATTER_FORMAT=histogram
MG_MACRO_HISTOGRAM_BINS=16
SPH_ITERATIONS=1
SPH_DAMPING=1.0
SPH_TARGET=flux                    # this same-partition diagnostic only
SPH_CLIP_MIN=
SPH_CLIP_MAX=
MAX_CE_FLUX_REL_STD=0.20
MAX_MG_FLUX_REL_STD=0.20
OPENMC_LIB_DIR=/path/to/openmc/build/lib
OPENMC2DONJON_COLORSET_VARIANT=three_region   # or two_region / five_region_2d
```

`OPENMC_LIB_DIR` is optional, but useful on macOS when the OpenMC executable
would otherwise pick up a stale `libopenmc.dylib` from another Python or conda
environment.

`SPH_DAMPING` controls the multiplicative SPH update (fixed direction: the
converged flux-target factor is the CE/MG flux ratio, so a low-order flux
that is too high produces a factor below unity and the corrected cross
sections increase):

```text
next_sph = previous_sph * (ce_flux / normalized_mg_flux) ** SPH_DAMPING
```

The default `1.0` is the undamped update.  For noisy or low-flux colorset
bins, use a smaller value such as `0.5` and optionally set `SPH_CLIP_MIN` /
`SPH_CLIP_MAX` to keep exploratory runs from being dominated by a single
statistically weak group.

The default particle counts are intentionally small so the workflow can be
tested quickly.  They are not high-statistics diagnostic settings.  If any MG region
has zero sampled flux, the flux export/SPH gate should fail; increase
`PARTICLES`/`BATCHES` rather than accepting a zero-flux SPH ratio.

## Output

The run directory contains:

handoff/physics_summary.json     machine-readable CE/MG/SPH audit summary
handoff/physics_summary.md       human-readable CE/MG/SPH audit summary
```

The SPH command gates both CE and MG flux uncertainty:

```sh
--require-reference-flux-std-dev
--max-reference-flux-std-dev-rel ...
--require-mg-flux-std-dev
--max-mg-flux-std-dev-rel ...
```

That keeps noisy OpenMC flux ratios from being silently promoted into
high-statistics diagnostic SPH factors.  It does not turn this same-partition,
flux-target example into accepted physical SPH.

The physics summary records the CE/MG flux uncertainty, SPH factor range by
mixture, and a reaction-rate preservation diagnostic.  The diagnostic compares
`CE-tallied MGXS * CE volume flux` against the OpenMC MG rate before/after the
new SPH update using the openmc2donjon `XS / NSPH` divisor convention (the
same application used by `apply-sph`; DONJON's native `MAC:` module applies
`NSPH` multiplicatively, see `PRODUCTION_EVIDENCE.md`).  With the default
flux-target update the after-update rate rows do not close to zero; rate
closure is the `--sph-target rate` fixed point.  It is
meant for review and demos; it is not a substitute for a benchmark-quality
validation.

The summary separates structural success from statistical quality.  Its
decision names predate the current physical-SPH contract and are retained for
schema compatibility:

- `openmc_ce_mg_sph_production_quality` is a historical label meaning only
  that the HDF5/ASCII data-carriage path is complete and both CE/MG flux
  relative standard deviations are at or below the 5% diagnostic review
  threshold.  It is **not** a physical-SPH production acceptance.
- `openmc_ce_mg_sph_demonstration_quality` means the diagnostic route is
  suitable for a quick demo, but its flux statistics are above that 5%
  threshold.
- `openmc_ce_mg_sph_statistical_review_required` means the diagnostic route
  completed, but the flux ratios are too noisy even for high-statistics
  handoff evidence.

The legacy JSON field `quality.production_ready` has the same limited meaning:
structure plus the historical statistical threshold.  It must not be read as
fine-to-coarse, rate-preserving physical acceptance.

For example, an 8-batch / 2000-particle smoke on the development machine
completed the diagnostic pipeline and wrote P3 handoff data plus H16 MG-macro evidence, but
the summary correctly marked it `statistical_review_required` because the
largest CE/MG flux relative standard deviation was about 0.65.

A 24-batch / 4000-particle run with 6 inactive batches on both CE and MG
sides reached `openmc_ce_mg_sph_demonstration_quality` on the development
machine:

```sh
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_demo_quality_20260709 \
BATCHES=24 INACTIVE=6 PARTICLES=4000 \
MG_BATCHES=24 MG_INACTIVE=6 MG_PARTICLES=4000 \
MAX_CE_FLUX_REL_STD=0.30 \
MAX_MG_FLUX_REL_STD=0.30 \
SPH_ITERATIONS=3 \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

That run gave CE/MG flux relative standard deviations of 0.231 / 0.184 and an
SPH range of 0.640 .. 1.326 (at these statistics the iterated factors are
dominated by the flux-ratio noise, not by a systematic defect).  It is
suitable as a live demonstration of the OpenMC-side SPH machinery, but it
remains above the 5% high-statistics diagnostic threshold.

A local high-statistics diagnostic reached the 5% CE/MG flux uncertainty
target with higher MG statistics (all recorded diagnostic evidence uses the
fixed update direction and `SPH_ITERATIONS=3`; the pre-fix records were
invalidated):

```sh
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_production_fixed_20260709 \
BATCHES=80 INACTIVE=20 PARTICLES=20000 \
MG_BATCHES=100 MG_INACTIVE=20 MG_PARTICLES=30000 \
MAX_CE_FLUX_REL_STD=0.05 \
MAX_MG_FLUX_REL_STD=0.05 \
SPH_ITERATIONS=3 \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

That run gave CE/MG flux relative standard deviations of 0.04282 / 0.02699
and an SPH range of 0.96575 .. 1.08736 with no clipped bins.  The summary
decision was `openmc_ce_mg_sph_production_quality`.  The flux-target update
does not close the frozen-flux reaction-rate diagnostic (that closure is the
`--sph-target rate` fixed point); the recorded rate residuals are reviewed in
`PRODUCTION_EVIDENCE.md`.  The decision string is retained for compatibility
and reports only handoff completeness plus the historical statistics gate.

The larger `five_region_2d` variant has also completed the same-partition
diagnostic pipeline at the 5% statistics threshold:

```sh
OPENMC2DONJON_COLORSET_VARIANT=five_region_2d \
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_five_region_2d_production_20260709 \
BATCHES=80 INACTIVE=20 PARTICLES=30000 \
MG_BATCHES=80 MG_INACTIVE=20 MG_PARTICLES=30000 \
MAX_CE_FLUX_REL_STD=0.05 \
MAX_MG_FLUX_REL_STD=0.05 \
SPH_ITERATIONS=3 \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_workflow.sh
```

That five-region run gave CE/MG flux relative standard deviations of
0.04062 / 0.04474, an SPH range of 0.92733 .. 1.13000, and no clipped SPH
bins.  The summary decision was `openmc_ce_mg_sph_production_quality`.  A
matching 2D DONJON diagnostic solved the uncorrected handoff and the
SPH-corrected operator and moved k, the CE flux-shape residuals, and the CE
reaction-rate residual toward the OpenMC CE reference for both diffusion and
SPN3.  The detailed table is in `NEXT_PHYSICS_VALIDATION.md`.

With the fixed update direction, `SPH_ITERATIONS=3` is the diagnostic default
for this example: the first iteration removes the systematic CE/MG defect
and later iterations sit at the Monte Carlo noise floor of the flux ratios.
The previously recorded conclusion that iterating OpenMC MG overshoots and
that one-shot SPH should be preferred was measured with the inverted
pre-fix update and no longer applies.

To close the downstream handoff, run the DONJON consumption smoke on the
produced MACROLIB:

```sh
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_production_fixed_20260709 \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_donjon_consume_smoke.sh
```

This is not a k-effective benchmark.  It verifies that DONJON can read the
exported `L_MACROLIB` ASCII, consume `GROUP/*/NSPH` through `DSPH:`, and apply
the PN correction through `MAC:`.  The smoke also checks the SN convention used
by DONJON: `DSPH:` consumes the same `NSPH` values, while `MAC:` leaves
`NTOT0` unchanged for the SN path in this convention.

For a slightly stronger downstream diagnostic, run a DONJON low-order solve
with the same MACROLIB:

```sh
RUN_ROOT=/private/tmp/openmc2donjon_ce_mg_sph_production_fixed_20260709 \
bash examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/run_donjon_solve_diagnostic.sh
```

This writes `donjon_solve_summary.json` and `donjon_solve_summary.md` under
`RUN_DIR` (default:
`/private/tmp/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_donjon_solve_diagnostic`).  It runs both a
diffusion and an SPN3 `TRIVAT/TRIVAA/FLUD` solve, exports the DONJON flux
object, and compares the DONJON flux unknowns against the OpenMC CE and OpenMC
MG volume fluxes after removing arbitrary eigenvector normalization.  For the
`five_region_2d` variant, the script uses a matching 3 x 2 `CAR2D` colorset and
area-weights the repeated left-fuel cells back to the single OpenMC output
region before comparison.  If
`handoff/out_uncorrected.macrolib.txt` is present, the script runs the same
geometry and solver settings for both the uncorrected and SPH-corrected
cases.  The SPH-corrected operator is prepared package-side with `apply-sph`
(`XS_corrected = XS / NSPH`); DONJON's native `DSPH:`/`MAC:` application is
multiplicative and is exercised by the consume smoke instead.  This is still
a diagnostic, not a benchmark acceptance
gate: the residual is reported for review rather than forced to pass a tight
threshold.

For the exact interpretation of the diffusion/SPN3 diagnostic, see
`DONJON_SOLVE_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.  For the proposed larger validation target, see
`NEXT_PHYSICS_VALIDATION.md`.

For a shorter presentation-ready summary of that high-statistics diagnostic,
see `PRODUCTION_EVIDENCE.md`; the filename is retained for existing links, not
as a physical acceptance claim.

## Damping sweep review

To compare several completed damping runs, use `summarize_damping_sweep.py`.
It reads existing `physics_summary.json` files and does not rerun OpenMC:

```sh
python examples/openmc_ce_mg_33g_sph_minicase/summarize_damping_sweep.py \
  --case damping_1p0=/path/to/run_damping_1p0 \
  --case damping_0p7=/path/to/run_damping_0p7 \
  --case damping_0p5=/path/to/run_damping_0p5 \
  --output-json /tmp/openmc_sph_damping_sweep.json \
  --output-md /tmp/openmc_sph_damping_sweep.md
```

The sweep table compares the current-solve reaction-rate residual, the
after-update frozen-flux residual, SPH range, update range, and flux
statistical uncertainty.  Use it to justify a damping recommendation instead
of selecting `SPH_DAMPING` from the SPH factor range alone.

A pre-fix 60-batch / 10000-particle sweep recorded here previously was
measured with the inverted update direction and its damping recommendations
are invalidated: it was characterizing the divergence rate of a structurally
unstable loop.  With the fixed update the undamped loop is already a
contraction, and damping mainly trades convergence speed against the Monte
Carlo noise accumulated by extra iterations.  A fresh sweep with the fixed
loop has not been recorded yet; use `summarize_damping_sweep.py` when one is
needed.

## What This Proves

- CE and MG calculations share geometry, output regions, and energy groups.
- The OpenMC MG macro solve can use Hn histogram scatter while the DONJON
  handoff remains Pn/Legendre.
- SPH factors are generated on the OpenMC side from CE/MG flux comparison.
- The converter carries those factors as `NSPH` into DONJON ASCII.
- The checked DONJON data-carriage path is `L_MACROLIB`, where `NSPH` is
  written as `GROUP/*/NSPH` and can be consumed by DONJON `DSPH:`/`MAC:`.
- DONJON-side SPH iteration is not part of this route.

## What It Does Not Prove

- This is not a benchmark-quality k-effective validation.
- This same-partition flux-target example is not production physical SPH,
  regardless of particle count.
- The default statistics are also too low for its high-statistics diagnostic
  review threshold.
- `L_MULTICOMPO + NCR:` currently extracts the macroscopic XS but does not
  promote OpenMC-side `NSPH` into non-unity `GROUP/*/NSPH`; use `L_MACROLIB`
  for the SPH consumption smoke.
- Angular-bin-dependent SPH factors, such as `SPH(region, group, H-bin)`, are
  not implemented here; only scalar region-by-group SPH is generated.
