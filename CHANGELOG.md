# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

For narrative release notes (rationale, validation status, migration tips),
see [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md). This file is a chronological
machine-readable index; cross-reference the release notes for context.

## [Unreleased]

- Added an experimental native OpenMC hexagonal face-current Python helper,
  provenance-checked HDF5 export, and a runnable verification example. It scores
  incoming/outgoing/net currents on explicit per-position/per-layer transmission
  faces and retains paired-batch covariance for net-current uncertainty. This is
  an optional diagnostic, not a new MGXS, SPH, or DONJON acceptance result.
- Extended `fill-zero-flux` with opt-in total-XS uncertainty and P0
  scatter-row overshoot criteria for solver-destabilizing micro-flux bins;
  repeated fills now retain the union of substituted-group provenance, and
  the standalone summary schema is now v2.
- Added the IRENA-30 full-core Stage 3 fine CE versus assembly-homogenized
  MG+DONJON full-core workflow, resumable SPH iterations, exact final-sidecar MG evaluation,
  120-degree local-factor regularization, and normalized power-shape closure.
  The empirical eigenvalue-fitted global scalar has been withdrawn from the
  frontend, web execution API, and runnable example. Stage 3 now permits only
  the rate-preserving CE/MG SPH fixed-point iteration with uncertainty and
  convergence gates. The existing physical full-core result is documented as
  **not accepted** pending convergence and independent closure.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-10

SPH physics release: update-direction fix (the pre-existing loop was
structurally divergent and even one-shot corrections carried the wrong
sign), rate-preserving `--sph-target rate` (k-pinning, DRAGON
semantics), fast-spectrum zero-flux/floor/freeze policies and the
`fill-zero-flux` command, IRENA Stage 1/2 colorset examples with the
PNL prescription validated to core level, regenerated minicase
evidence, verified DONJON NSPH consumption routes, and web-frontend
wiring for the new options.

See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the full narrative.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-07

Accepted hex benchmark release. Adds the IRENA-30 ZREFL 91-hex benchmark
(the first accepted hex validation line, SN8 k-eff within Monte Carlo
statistics and fission-source shape within 1.3 % worst / 0.5 % RMS),
the SPH sidecar/augmentation and external face-flux workflows, and the
C5G7 accepted-artifact parity refresh for the uncertainty-preserving
exporter.

See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the full narrative.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-22

OpenMC end-to-end workflow release. Adds the recipe-based statepoint
exporter, the one-step `openmc2donjon-from-openmc` entry point, ADF and
SPH equivalence carry-through, and
the accepted C5G7 production handoff with flux-ratio ADF and SPH factors.

See [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for the full narrative.

## [0.1.1] - C5G7 handoff snapshot

Tagged as `v0.1.1-c5g7-handoff`. Mid-stream snapshot used to publish the
accepted C5G7 ADF + SPH handoff artifact before the OpenMC workflow
release.

## [0.1.0] - C5G7 accepted baseline

Tagged as `v0.1.0-c5g7-accepted`. First accepted C5G7 assembly-wise
DONJON/DRAGON validation: diffusion and SPN3 k-effective against an
OpenMC reference, with documented bias margins.
