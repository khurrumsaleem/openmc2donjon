`openmc2donjon` is a general OpenMC-MGXS-to-DRAGON/DONJON Converter and
handoff workflow.
Converter is its mandatory core: every formal handoff validates one declared
MGXS HDF5, writes `L_MULTICOMPO` or `L_MACROLIB`, and records a hash-linked
receipt. The HDF5 may represent one assembly, one component with any number of
homogenization domains, an arbitrary colorset, or a full-core coarse model.

The product architecture is:

- **Converter:** required formal handoff boundary.
- **OpenMC MGXS:** optional input preparation when the HDF5 does not exist.
- **Physical SPH:** optional rate-preserving OpenMC CE/MG equivalence when the
  homogenized coarse model requires it.
- **Project:** optional coordination for repeated or multi-component jobs.
- **Inspect:** independent, read-only HDF5 structure and MGXS diagnostics.
- **DONJON:** downstream use and independent validation.
- **PyGan:** optional writer and semantic cross-validation backend inside
  Converter.

The stable path is:

```text
one declared MGXS HDF5
  -> Converter production validation
  -> L_MULTICOMPO or L_MACROLIB + receipt
  -> user- or project-defined DRAGON/DONJON consumer
```

## Web Interface Quick Start

The local Web interface exposes the same Converter and validation code as the
CLI. Python 3.10 or newer is required; Node.js 20 is the CI-tested frontend
runtime.

Install both parts from a fresh checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arbreCui/openmc2donjon.git
cd openmc2donjon
python -m pip install -e ".[web]"
cd web
npm ci
cd ..
```

Start the backend from the repository root in the first terminal:

```sh
openmc2donjon serve              # http://localhost:8000
```

Start the frontend in a second terminal:

```sh
cd web
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:3000
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. Start on the page that matches the job:

| Page | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [`/convert`](http://localhost:3000/convert) | You already have an MGXS HDF5 and want the required checked `L_MULTICOMPO` or `L_MACROLIB` handoff. |
| [`/inspect`](http://localhost:3000/inspect) | You only want to browse and visualize an OpenMC MGXS HDF5 without converting it. |
| [`/openmc`](http://localhost:3000/openmc) | You do not yet have a Converter-ready OpenMC MGXS HDF5 and need to prepare one first. |
| [`/equivalence`](http://localhost:3000/equivalence) | Before final conversion, the declared model needs the OpenMC MG SPH sidecar/application steps that produce a corrected HDF5. |
| [`/projects`](http://localhost:3000/projects) | You need to coordinate repeated, multi-component, or full-core jobs. |
| [`/pygan`](http://localhost:3000/pygan) | You want to check PyGan availability or compare the ASCII and PyGan writers. |
| [`/donjon`](http://localhost:3000/donjon) | You are ready to consume or verify the converted object in DONJON. |

`openmc2donjon serve` is live mode: it reads real local files and runs the real
package APIs. For a frontend-only demonstration, use `openmc2donjon serve
--mock`; mock mode serves fixtures and does not perform a production
conversion.

PyGan is optional. To enable it in the Web interface, start the backend from
the same Python environment in which this command reports
`pygan_backend=available`:

```sh
openmc2donjon pygan-doctor
```

If PyGan is unavailable, Converter remains fully usable through its built-in
ASCII writer. See [Web Interface Details](#web-interface-details) and
[`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for custom backend addresses and development
notes.

When physical SPH is selected, the standard route holds a heterogeneous
OpenMC CE calculation fixed as the fine reference and iterates a homogenized
OpenMC MG calculation as the coarse equivalence solve. The two calculations
do not use the same geometry: the CE model resolves the fine heterogeneity,
while the MG model uses the declared homogenized regions. The CE reference
tallies must use the MG transport group boundaries; both models must represent
the same physical state and boundary conditions and declare a conservative
comparison-domain map so that each coarse region corresponds to the same
physical volume and preserves the integrated reference flux and reaction rates.
Their native OpenMC domain IDs may differ and are mapped independently into
the same canonical domain order.

```text
heterogeneous OpenMC CE fine reference
  -> conservative collapse onto declared comparison domains
  -> homogenized OpenMC MG coarse solve
  -> rate-preserving SPH update, XS / NSPH, and MG rerun to convergence
  -> corrected MGXS HDF5 with sph_applied=true
  -> Converter validation + L_MULTICOMPO or L_MACROLIB + receipt
  -> project-defined DONJON verification
```

Every formal handoff still crosses Converter; SPH does not bypass its preflight,
writer, or hash-linked receipt. Physical SPH permits no ADF substitution,
global multiplier, empirical calibration, k-effective fitting, or numerical
exemption such as identity substitution, floors, frozen groups, or clipping.

An advanced project may instead declare an external native DRAGON `SPH:` solve.
In that project-specific route, Converter first writes the uncorrected reference
MACROLIB and receipt; the external DRAGON installation owns the SPH iteration,
and `validate-native-sph` audits its deck, listing, corrected object, and
verification evidence. This is not the standard built-in SPH operator.

Generic Converter inputs may carry explicitly supplied ADF/DF records for
separately declared workflows. Preserving those records is not permission to
use ADF in a physical-SPH route, and Converter never invents or fits an ADF or
empirical correction.

## Export And Convert Modes

Both invocation styles ship:

- two-step: `openmc2donjon-export` writes `mgxs_library.h5`, then
  `openmc2donjon` converts it to ASCII. This is useful when the HDF5 is shared,
  archived, or post-processed between stages.
- one-step: `openmc2donjon-from-openmc` exports, checks, converts, and bundles
  a managed run directory in a single command.

Either invocation style produces the same Converter-facing HDF5. A direct
handoff can stop after Converter; a physical-equivalence project iterates the
standard OpenMC CE/MG route above before sending the corrected HDF5 through
Converter. An explicitly declared external native-DRAGON route remains an
advanced project option.

## Output Formats

- `L_MULTICOMPO` as `.mcompo.txt` for mapped domain-wise libraries.
- `L_MACROLIB` as `.macrolib.txt` for direct one-state macrolib handoffs.

Accepted validation: C5G7 assembly-wise OpenMC -> DONJON handoff with
documented k-effective comparisons; see [Validation Status](#validation-status).

## PyGan Integration

The default converter backend is the pure Python ASCII LCM writer shipped in
this package. PyGan is treated as an optional DRAGON/DONJON integration layer
for validation, inspection, and an alternate writer backend.

These are deliberately separate statuses. The built-in ASCII writer is always
the normal OpenMC-to-DONJON handoff path. PyGan being unavailable only disables
PyGan-backed export and writer-comparison evidence; it does not block ordinary
`.mcompo.txt` or `.macrolib.txt` conversion.

Recommended PyGan demonstration path:

1. Check whether the optional backend is available:

```sh
openmc2donjon pygan-doctor
```

2. Write the same converter LCM tree through PyGan instead of the built-in
   ASCII writer:

```sh
openmc2donjon mgxs_library.h5 \
  --writer-backend pygan \
  --format multicompo \
  -o out.mcompo.txt \
  --production \
  --summary-json out.mcompo.txt.convert.json
```

3. Compare the default writer and PyGan writer semantically:

```sh
openmc2donjon compare-writers mgxs_library.h5 \
  --format multicompo \
  --summary-json writer_compare.json
```

4. Run the optional local PyGan backend smoke:

```sh
bash scripts/run_pygan_backend_smoke.sh
```

The smoke skips cleanly when PyGan is not installed. When PyGan is available,
it compares both `L_MULTICOMPO` and `L_MACROLIB` writer outputs against the
default ASCII backend using the bundled C5G7 production fixture. If DONJON is
also available locally, the same smoke runs a read-only CLE-2000 ingest deck so
DONJON itself reads the PyGan-exported ASCII files, runs `NCR:` on the PyGan
`L_MULTICOMPO`, and checks the extracted macrolib against the PyGan direct
`L_MACROLIB`.

5. Inspect the root structure of a DRAGON/DONJON LCM ASCII COMPO through
   PyGan:

```sh
openmc2donjon pygan-inspect-compo FUEL30.COMPO --summary-json fuel30.pygan.json
```

If PyGan is not installed, conversion still works through the default ASCII
writer. Installing PyGan is useful when you want Python-side access to native
DRAGON/DONJON LCM objects, want PyGan to export the ASCII file, or want to run
CLE-2000 procedures as part of a local validation harness.

In the localhost Web UI, `/pygan` shows the default ASCII writer and optional
PyGan writer as two separate cards, then reports the PyGan doctor result,
module import paths, and a runnable ASCII-vs-PyGan writer comparison report.
`/convert` reports whether PyGan is importable from the running backend Python
environment; when a PyGan conversion succeeds, the result panel links directly
to the prefilled `/pygan` comparison workflow.

See [docs/PYGAN_BACKEND.md](docs/PYGAN_BACKEND.md) for install notes, command
examples, and the current scope of the optional backend.

## Quick Start

New users should start with the short path-oriented guide:

- [User README: HDF5 -> Convert -> Bundle -> DONJON](docs/CONVERTER_USER_README.md)
- [Physics evidence audit and next accepted closure](docs/PHYSICS_EVIDENCE_AUDIT.md)

Clone and install from a fresh checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arbreCui/openmc2donjon.git
cd openmc2donjon
python -m pip install -e .
openmc2donjon --help
```

Check an MGXS handoff before conversion:

```sh
openmc2donjon check mgxs_library.h5 --production
```

Convert to MULTICOMPO:

```sh
openmc2donjon mgxs_library.h5 -o out.mcompo.txt --production \
  --summary-json out.mcompo.txt.convert.json
```

Convert to MACROLIB:

```sh
openmc2donjon mgxs_library.h5 --format macrolib \
  -o out.macrolib.txt --production \
  --summary-json out.macrolib.txt.convert.json
```

Run a tiny recipe/export smoke without OpenMC data:

```sh
bash scripts/run_recipe_export_smoke.sh
```

For the full walkthrough, see [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

## OpenMC Entry Points

Most real cases should use a small Python recipe that builds the case-specific
OpenMC `mgxs.Library` and assigns stable spatial domain names.

The recipe is a separate adapter and need not share a directory with the
OpenMC `main.py`. Before the OpenMC transport run, generate the exact MGXS
tallies declared by the recipe:

```sh
openmc2donjon-export --recipe export_recipe.py --write-tallies tallies.xml
```

No `main.py` change is needed if that driver uses the generated `tallies.xml`.
If it constructs an in-memory `openmc.Model`, supplies its own tallies, or
exports XML again, integrate the same recipe-library tallies or run in the order
`export model XML -> generate tallies.xml -> run OpenMC`. A statepoint that did
not score the recipe's MGXS cannot be repaired after the run.

Set `library.correction = None` before `library.build_library()`, including for
P0 scattering. OpenMC defaults to a P0 diagonal transport correction; that
corrected matrix cannot be paired with the raw total cross section written by
Converter. Active P0 correction is rejected during recipe checks and export.

The ordinary static cross-section policy pairs OpenMC `absorption` with an
ordinary `scatter matrix` or `consistent scatter matrix`. A fast-spectrum
static policy that retains `(n,xn)` neutron multiplicity must additionally tally
`reduced absorption`, explicitly select `consistent nu-scatter matrix`, and pair
it with `nu-transport` instead of ordinary `transport`;
users do not manually edit either vector or matrix. Converter checks the
declared pair, then writes `NTOT0` and the selected `SCAT`/`SIGS` records. The
downstream static removal is therefore implicit in `NTOT0` minus the outgoing
P0 scatter row; no separate absorption block or `N2N`/`N3N` depletion record is
emitted. See the
[OpenMC export workflow](docs/OPENMC_EXPORT_WORKFLOW.md) and
[fast-spectrum workflow](docs/FAST_SPECTRUM_WORKFLOW.md).

Export only the converter-facing HDF5:

```sh
openmc2donjon-export \
  --recipe export_recipe.py \
  --statepoint statepoint.120.h5 \
  -o mgxs_library.h5
```

Export and convert in one managed run directory:

```sh
openmc2donjon-from-openmc \
  --recipe export_recipe.py \
  --statepoint statepoint.120.h5 \
  --run-dir runs/case1 \
  --check
```

Inspect a recipe before writing files:

```sh
openmc2donjon-export --recipe export_recipe.py --no-load-statepoint --dry-run
openmc2donjon-from-openmc --recipe export_recipe.py --dry-run --run-dir runs/case1 --check
```

## Spatial Domain Rule

The converter preserves the OpenMC spatial partition:

- one OpenMC MGXS domain becomes one HDF5 mixture;
- one HDF5 mixture becomes one DONJON mixture;
- the DONJON geometry places that mixture back at the matching spatial position.

Recipe/statepoint exports also embed a content-hash-bound OpenMC provenance
record. It binds both a declared-complete fine-model input manifest and the
actual numerical HDF5 payload; the one-step v5 summary additionally binds the
final HDF5 and ASCII bytes. This makes the fine reference and the final
Converter handoff auditable without treating a path name or copied sidecar as
physics evidence.

This is intentionally not material-collapsed. Two domains with the same
material may still receive different homogenized cross sections because their
spectra, leakage, and neighbor effects differ.

For a 3D assembly-wise workflow, a typical domain might be
`assembly position + axial layer`. If a core has 193 assemblies and 20 axial
layers, the handoff contains 3860 spatial mixtures.

## Production Checks

`openmc2donjon check --production` enables the project production baseline:

- explicit positive volumes;
- explicit `transport_total`;
- group-wise H-FACTOR/kappa-fission for fissionable calculations;
- stable declared mixture order and source-domain provenance;
- for OpenMC-source handoffs, an intact recipe/statepoint reference binding;
- energy-bound consistency and known mesh audit metadata;
- scatter row-balance, chi normalization, ADF face consistency, and
  transport/P1 consistency gates;
- complete `*_std_dev` coverage in production, a hard uncertainty gate for
  one-dimensional/P0 production data, and warning-level disclosure of noisy
  P1+ moments unless a model-specific all-data criterion is declared.

## Physical SPH

Physical SPH is optional. Use it only when the homogenized model needs an
explicit equivalence closure. The standard physical route is a fixed
heterogeneous OpenMC CE fine reference -> homogenized OpenMC MG coarse solve ->
rate-preserving SPH iteration -> corrected HDF5 -> Converter -> DONJON
verification. A standalone assembly is a valid SPH comparison when the
declared fine and coarse problems are physically matched; geometry size alone
neither accepts nor rejects it.

The general contract accepts any positive number of declared domains. It
requires a matched fine reference and coarse model, rate preservation,
convergence, zero numerical exemptions, and hash-linked artifacts. “Matched”
does not mean geometrically identical: the CE geometry retains heterogeneity
and the MG geometry is homogenized. The energy groups, state, boundary
conditions, and conservative fine-to-coarse comparison-domain map must agree.
The map must be complete and non-overlapping and preserve physical volume plus
integrated reference flux and reaction rates. The final HDF5 must record
`sph_applied=true`; Converter is the mandatory formal boundary and never
invents or fits a factor.

The commands below implement the standard OpenMC CE/MG route. Use
`--sph-target rate` for the rate-preserving fixed point and repeat the MG
solve/update until the declared convergence criterion passes.

Entry points:

```sh
openmc2donjon make-openmc-sph-sidecar mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o sph_sidecar.h5 \
  --reference-flux openmc_ce_flux.h5::openmc_volume_flux \
  --mg-flux openmc_mg_flux.h5::openmc_mg_flux \
  --sph-target rate \
  --flux-normalization power

# OpenMC-side SPH iteration:
# write corrected OpenMC-native MGXS (XS / NSPH), rerun OpenMC MG with it,
# then recompute the SPH sidecar from the new MG flux.
openmc2donjon apply-sph mg_case/mgxs_unapplied.h5 \
  --input-format openmc-mgxs \
  --sph-source sph_sidecar.h5 \
  -o mg_case/mgxs.h5

# Final Converter handoff path (MULTICOMPO or MACROLIB is chosen downstream):
openmc2donjon apply-sph mgxs_library.h5 \
  --sph-source sph_sidecar.h5 \
  -o mgxs_sph_applied.h5
openmc2donjon mgxs_sph_applied.h5 --format multicompo \
  -o out.mcompo.txt --production --require-physical-sph
```

For an explicitly declared advanced native-DRAGON project, first use Converter
to write and receipt an uncorrected reference `L_MACROLIB`, then run the
project-owned external `SPH:` deck and audit it with `validate-native-sph`.
That route depends on an external DRAGON/DONJON installation and does not
replace the standard OpenMC MG operator.

## Validation Status

Current validation line:

- C5G7 assembly-wise OpenMC-to-DONJON handoff with DONJON k-effective checks.
- The accepted IRENA-30 ZREFL 91-hex OpenMC-MG -> Converter -> DONJON
  SN8/SCAT2 baseline agrees with its paired OpenMC-MG reference in k-effective
  and fission-source shape. It validates downstream hex mapping and solver
  mechanics; it is not CE-fine/OpenMC-MG-SPH/full-core physics acceptance.
- Converter round trips for `L_MULTICOMPO` and `L_MACROLIB`.
- Mechanics smokes for recipe export, full-core domain mapping, hex geometry
  capability, and SPH handoff mechanics.

There is currently no accepted IRENA continuous-energy fine -> SPH ->
full-core result. Earlier local PNL/EXT and INT/EXT summaries are withdrawn as
physics passes: their listings contain unconverged final transport solves, and
their local boundary/volume contract does not establish the full-core leakage
environment. A future candidate must keep all 91 fine assemblies (or a proved
conservative symmetry mapping), build the corresponding homogenized OpenMC MG
comparison domains, converge the rate-preserving SPH update, pass the corrected
HDF5 through Converter, and then pass joint k-effective, leakage, power-shape,
statistical, and numerical-convergence gates. No ADF or empirical/global
eigenvalue factor is permitted.

Run portable checks:

```sh
bash scripts/portable_release_smoke.sh
bash scripts/run_recipe_export_smoke.sh
bash scripts/run_c5g7_demo.sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

GitHub CI and `scripts/portable_release_smoke.sh` are software/fixture gates:
they do not require OpenMC, DRAGON/DONJON, or PyGan and do not claim a physics
benchmark by themselves. Run the full local release gate, including optional
DONJON-dependent smokes when the local DRAGON/DONJON checkout is available:

```sh
bash scripts/release_check.sh
bash scripts/release_check.sh --run-donjon
```

- [Release gates](docs/RELEASE_GATES.md)
- [Current handoff snapshot](docs/HANDOFF_SNAPSHOT.md)
- [Release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)
- [C5G7 DONJON snapshot](examples/donjon_openmc2donjon/)

## Output Contract

The CLI keeps stdout as a result stream and stderr as diagnostics:

- reports, generated paths, and "wrote/exported/injected" confirmations use
  stdout;
- diagnostic errors, warnings, progress, and debug detail use the package
  logger on stderr;
- `-v`, `-vv`, `-q`, and `--log-level` control diagnostic verbosity.

This is enforced by `tests/test_print_audit.py` so accidental status
`print()` calls do not leak into business logic.

## Development

Install developer tools:

```sh
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the local gates:

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests
ruff check .
mypy --no-incremental \
  src/openmc2donjon/constants.py \
  src/openmc2donjon/scatter.py \
  src/openmc2donjon/energy_groups.py \
  src/openmc2donjon/mgxs_physics_checks.py
```

CI runs the same unit-test matrix on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12, plus Ruff,
the whitelisted strict mypy gate, and a frontend job that lints, type-checks,
and builds the `web/` Next.js project.

## Web Interface Details

A localhost-only Next.js + FastAPI web UI lives in [`web/`](web/), wired to
the same Python package as the CLI. It includes a command workspace
(`Commands`), OpenMC MGXS preparation (`OpenMC`), the core Converter workflow
(`Converter`), HDF5 inspection (`Inspect`), physical SPH tools (`SPH`), optional
project coordination (`Projects`), PyGan integration (`PyGan`), DONJON guidance
(`DONJON`), and generic CLI command builders (`Builder`).

For installation, the two-terminal launch sequence, and direct page links,
follow [Web Interface Quick Start](#web-interface-quick-start).

`openmc2donjon serve --mock` returns fixture data instead of calling the
real package APIs — useful for frontend-only development. See
[`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for full layout and conventions.

Live mode is localhost-first. If you bind the backend to a non-loopback host,
constrain filesystem access with `--workspace-root /path/to/openmc-runs`;
otherwise the server refuses to start unless `--unsafe-remote` is explicitly
requested.

The Web UI is intentionally localhost-first. Converter production validation,
the standard OpenMC-side SPH sidecar/application operations, project
creation/status, read-only HDF5 inspection, PyGan writer comparison, and DONJON
diagnostics can run locally. Advanced projects can also run and validate an
exact external native-DRAGON deck; that project-specific runner is not the
standard SPH algorithm.

## Roadmap

Near-term work:

- produce one hash-linked IRENA 91-position/21-D3-orbit result through the
  standard OpenMC CE fine -> OpenMC MG coarse rate-SPH -> Converter -> DONJON
  route and every full-core acceptance gate;
- keep standard energy-mesh identification and uncertainty coverage visible in
  every production audit surface;
- broader mypy coverage for small pure helper modules.

Larger physics work remains separate from the format converter core:

- full downstream uncertainty propagation beyond exported OpenMC `std_dev`
  coverage and preflight gates;
- additional production examples and benchmark comparisons.

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
