# HDF5 Input Contract

`openmc2donjon` consumes a compact HDF5 export of OpenMC MGXS data. The file is
not required to be an OpenMC statepoint; it is a deliberately small handoff
format with one group structure and one or more spatial MGXS domains.

The package includes a duck-typed OpenMC exporter for this contract:

```python
from openmc2donjon import DomainExportSpec, export_openmc_mgxs_library

export_openmc_mgxs_library(library, "mgxs_library.h5")
```

It expects an OpenMC `mgxs.Library`-like object with `energy_groups`, `domains`,
and `get_mgxs(domain, mgxs_type)`. It writes one HDF5 mixture group per OpenMC
MGXS domain.

For mesh or cell subdomains, use explicit export specs:

```python
export_openmc_mgxs_library(
    library,
    "mgxs_library.h5",
    domain_specs=[
        DomainExportSpec(
            domain=mesh,
            name="ASM_Y01_X01",
            xs_kwargs={"subdomains": [(1, 1, 1)]},
            volume=assembly_volume,
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Domain Rule

The mapping is spatial:

```text
one OpenMC MGXS domain
  -> one homogenized cross-section set
  -> one DONJON mixture
```

Do not collapse domains just because they share a material label. If two
assemblies or components occupy different positions, keep them as distinct
domains so OpenMC spectrum, leakage, and neighbor effects are retained.

For 3D cases, choose the spatial partition explicitly. A common choice is:

```text
assembly position + axial layer -> one MGXS domain -> one DONJON mixture
```

## Supported Schema Variants

| HDF5 layout | Status | Required state metadata | Converter behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One-state `/mixtures/<domain_name>/...` | Production path | None | Writes one calculation per mixture. |
| One-dimensional burnup history | Experimental | Exactly one `BURN` axis from `/state_points/BURN`, `/burnup_values`, `/burnup`, or matching root attrs | Writes `NPAR=1`, `PARKEY=BURN`, one calculation per burnup value, and per-mixture `TREE`. |
| Multi-axis branch library | Not supported | More than one branch axis, such as `BORON`, `TEMP`, `COOLANT`, or control state | Preflight and converter fail explicitly. |

The one-state schema is the accepted C5G7 validation path. The `BURN` schema is
intended for a single depletion/history axis only; it is not a general
temperature/boron/control branch-library format.

## Required Root Items

Required attributes:

| Path | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/attrs/energy_groups` | integer | number of energy groups `G` |
| `/attrs/legendre_order` | integer | highest scattering Legendre order `L` |

Required datasets:

| Path | Shape | Units/Order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/energy_bounds` | `(G + 1,)` | eV, ascending low-to-high |

## OpenMC Fine-Reference Provenance

Recipe/statepoint exports embed a canonical record at:

```text
/provenance/openmc/record_json
```

The root mirrors only its schema, status, and SHA256 in
`openmc_provenance_schema`, `openmc_provenance_status`, and
`openmc_provenance_sha256`. The full JSON binds the recipe and loaded
statepoint bytes, OpenMC/openmc2donjon versions, model inputs, run controls,
and the actually selected nuclear-data libraries when those sources are
available.

The record also stores `handoff.payload_sha256`, a canonical digest of every
scientific HDF5 path, attribute, dtype, shape, and value outside
`/provenance/openmc`. Inspector and production preflight recompute it. Copying
a valid source record onto different MGXS data, or changing an XS/flux/energy
dataset after export, therefore invalidates the frozen reference.

The three capability flags have deliberately different meanings:

| Capability | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `reference_bound` | The frozen MGXS reference is tied to a verified recipe and real OpenMC statepoint by content hash. This is what the standard OpenMC CE/MG SPH workflow and any advanced external solver route need. |
| `export_replayable` | The statepoint-to-MGXS export can be reconstructed from recorded source definitions and versions. |
| `transport_reproducible` | The original OpenMC transport inputs, run controls, and used nuclear-data content are fully identified. This is the publication-level claim. |

`export_replayable` and `transport_reproducible` additionally require the
recipe to attest input closure. The recipe's `provenance_files()` manifest must
include imported Python modules, CAD/DAGMC and mesh inputs, external sources,
weight windows, and every other file capable of changing the model or tallies.
OpenMC statepoint and settings values are recorded separately; disagreements
are errors rather than silently choosing one source.
The replay gate requires run mode, histories/batches, inactive and
generations-per-batch for eigenvalue runs, plus RNG seed and stride. MPI ranks
and thread count are retained when a run receipt supplies them, but are
reported as execution topology rather than substituted from the current shell.

The standard OpenMC CE/MG SPH workflow reruns the homogenized MG coarse model
while holding the heterogeneous CE reference fixed. An advanced external
native-DRAGON project does not rerun OpenMC; it consumes an uncorrected
Converter reference MACROLIB and its receipt. In either case, a managed run
directory copies small model source files by default, while large statepoints
and nuclear-data libraries remain external but hash-bound.

The converter writes DONJON `ENERGY` as `energy_bounds[::-1]`. Cross-section
arrays are kept in OpenMC group-index order, which is high energy to low energy
for the group structures used here.

## Required Mixture Items

For each spatial domain:

```text
/mixtures/<domain_name>/
    total
    absorption
    fission
    nu_fission
    chi
    scatter_matrix
```

Required datasets:

| Dataset | Shape | DONJON field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `total` | `(G,)` | `NTOT0` |
| `absorption` | `(G,)` | ordinary OpenMC absorption reaction-rate observable; also the ordinary-scatter balance term |
| `fission` | `(G,)` | `NFTOT` when the mixture is fissionable; exact zeros otherwise |
| `nu_fission` | `(G,)` | `NUSIGF` when the mixture is fissionable; exact zeros otherwise |
| `chi` | `(G,)` | `CHI` when the mixture is fissionable; exact zeros otherwise |
| `scatter_matrix` | `(L + 1, G_in, G_out)` or `(G_in, G_out, L + 1)` | `SIGSxx` and `SCATxx` |

The `fissionable` attribute is an explicit contract, not a display hint.
`fissionable=true` requires nonzero `fission`, `nu_fission`, and `chi`
vectors. `fissionable=false` requires those three vectors to be exactly zero.
Converter rejects either contradiction instead of silently clearing or
reclassifying the fission source. For a fissionable calculation, `fission`
and `nu_fission` must also have identical positive group support. Their ratio
is the group-wise effective neutron yield; Converter records its observed
minimum and maximum but applies no universal magnitude range.

Recommended mixture attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fissionable` | bool | required physical fission-source declaration |
| `scatter_format` | string | normally `legendre` |
| `scatter_axes` | string | normally `moment,from,to` |
| `volume` | float | spatial-domain volume; when present, strictly positive and finite |
| `openmc_scatter_mgxs_type` | string | selected OpenMC scattering estimator: ordinary `scatter matrix` / `consistent scatter matrix`, or explicitly nu-weighted `nu-scatter matrix` / `consistent nu-scatter matrix` |
| `openmc_scatter_multiplicity_weighted` | bool | whether the selected scattering matrix includes outgoing-neutron multiplicity |
| `openmc_scatter_balance_dataset` | string | `absorption` for ordinary scattering; `reduced_absorption` for nu-weighted scattering |
| `openmc_transport_mgxs_type` | string | OpenMC estimator used for `transport_total`: `transport` with ordinary scattering, or `nu-transport` with nu-weighted scattering |

## Optional Mixture Items

| Dataset | Shape | DONJON field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reduced_absorption` | `(G,)` | fast-spectrum balance audit paired with multiplicity-weighted scattering; required when `openmc_scatter_balance_dataset=reduced_absorption` |
| `transport_total` | `(G,)` | `STRD` |
| `inverse_velocity`, `inverse-velocity`, `OVERV`, or `overv` | `(G,)` | `OVERV` |
| `volume` | scalar | mixture volume |
| `flux_weight`, `flux`, or `flux_integral` | `(G,)` | legacy Inspect-only data; Converter does not consume it |
| `h_factor`, `H-FACTOR`, `H_FACTOR`, `kappa_fission`, `kappa_fission_xs`, or `kappa_fission_cross_section` | `(G,)` | `H-FACTOR` |
| `sph`, `SPH`, or `NSPH` | `(G,)` | `NSPH` |

All accepted inverse-velocity spellings must contain positive, finite values.
All accepted H-factor spellings must contain non-negative, finite values. These
are the same value-domain checks applied by Converter when it builds the
DRAGON/DONJON object.

If P1 or higher scattering is present, `transport_total` is required.  A bare
P1 row sum is not the OpenMC `TransportXS` definition, so Converter does not
silently derive `STRD` from the scattering matrix.  Export OpenMC's
matching `transport` MGXS for ordinary scattering, or `nu-transport` MGXS for
nu-weighted scattering, from the same calculation instead. Exporter-written
files declare that source in `openmc_transport_mgxs_type`. A nu-weighted file
that contains `transport_total` without this declaration is rejected because
an older ordinary `TransportXS` cannot be reinterpreted as `nu-transport`.
For backward compatibility only, an ordinary-scatter file with
`transport_total` but no transport-source attribute is interpreted as the
ordinary `transport` estimator and reported as an undeclared legacy contract.

When a calculation also carries a strictly positive, mixture-ordered
`/openmc_volume_flux`, preflight can evaluate the diagnostic identity

```text
transport_total[g_out]
  = total[g_out]
    - sum_g_in(flux[g_in] * P1[g_in -> g_out]) / flux[g_out]
```

The check is skipped when the flux cannot be bound to the calculation.  This
diagnostic does not replace the explicit `transport_total` dataset and its
uncertainty; it is not a row-sum reconstruction rule.  With P0-only
scattering, absence of `transport_total` means `STRD` falls back to `NTOT0`.

For a file declaring `sph_applied=true` and
`sph_apply_operator="divide-xs-by-nsph"`, this diagnostic uses
`flux_check = applied_sph * flux_CE`. The supported operator divides total,
transport, and each incoming scattering row by its group factor, so this
transformed check flux preserves the same identity. Preflight requires a
finite, positive `applied_sph` vector for each checked calculation and rejects
missing factors or an unsupported operator. It leaves the stored CE reference
flux and cross sections unchanged. This is an algebraic consistency check;
passing it does not establish that the SPH iteration physically converged.

Converter writes `FLUX-INTG` only from the mixture-ordered root
`/openmc_volume_flux` contract below. It does not infer a reference flux from
the ambiguous calculation-local `flux_weight`, `flux`, or `flux_integral`
names. Those legacy vectors remain visible in Inspect so existing files can be
diagnosed without silently assigning them new physics semantics.

### Absorption/scattering policy and `(n,xn)`

The HDF5 contract supports two static, physically paired policies:

| Policy | HDF5/OpenMC source pair | Transport estimator | Balance term |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary | `absorption` + ordinary `scatter matrix` or `consistent scatter matrix` | `transport` | `absorption` |
| Multiplicity-weighted fast spectrum | `absorption` + `reduced_absorption` + `consistent nu-scatter matrix` | `nu-transport` | `reduced_absorption` |

The required `absorption` dataset remains present in the second policy as the
ordinary absorption reaction-rate observable. It is not the removal term to
pair with nu-weighted scattering. Recipe/statepoint export records the selected
scatter type, whether it is multiplicity-weighted, its paired transport
estimator, and the matching balance dataset in the attributes above. A declared nu-weighted matrix without
`reduced_absorption` is invalid; the exporter does not silently manufacture the
missing estimator.

The word `consistent` identifies OpenMC's estimator construction; by itself it
does not imply neutron multiplicity. Only a type containing `nu-scatter` is the
multiplicity-weighted policy and therefore requires `reduced_absorption`.

Converter does not ask users to edit an absorption vector or scatter matrix.
It writes `total` as `NTOT0` and the selected matrix as DONJON `SCAT`/`SIGS`;
DONJON's static net absorption is consequently implicit in `NTOT0` minus the
outgoing P0 scattering row. With the fast-spectrum pair, this retains neutron
multiplication from `(n,xn)` consistently. The static HDF5-to-MACROLIB or
MULTICOMPO route does not emit separate `N2N` or `N3N` depletion-reaction
records.

## Optional Statistical Uncertainty Datasets

Any mean MGXS dataset may have a sibling dataset named `<dataset>_std_dev`
with the same shape:

```text
/mixtures/<domain_name>/total
/mixtures/<domain_name>/total_std_dev

/mixtures/<domain_name>/scatter_matrix
/mixtures/<domain_name>/scatter_matrix_std_dev
```

The OpenMC exporter writes these datasets when the source MGXS object exposes
standard-deviation data, either through a `std_dev`/`stddev`/`std` attribute or
through `get_xs(value="std_dev")`. This applies to `total`, `absorption`,
`reduced_absorption`, `fission`, `kappa_fission`, `nu_fission`, `chi`,
`transport_total`, `inverse_velocity`, and `scatter_matrix`.

`openmc2donjon-from-openmc --summary-json` records two coverage counters:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `std_dev_dataset_count` | Number of `*_std_dev` datasets written. |
| `std_dev_expected_dataset_count` | Number of source MGXS datasets that could have supplied matching uncertainty data. |

The expected count intentionally excludes exporter-synthesized zero fission
fields in non-fissionable mixtures. Those fields are deterministic placeholders,
not OpenMC tally means with missing uncertainty.

Preflight can consume these uncertainty datasets:

```sh
openmc2donjon check mgxs_library.h5 \
  --uncertainty-warn 0.05 \
  --uncertainty-fail 0.20
```

Production mode keeps the same data model, requires matching `*_std_dev`
coverage for every eligible mean dataset, and applies its production-critical
uncertainty gate to available `*_std_dev / |mean|` values above the mean floor.
The production-critical mask contains all one-dimensional MGXS fields and P0
scatter. P1 and higher signed scatter moments remain fully covered and are
reported through the all-data maximum, warnings, and top findings, but have no
default universal hard relative-error gate. A declared `--uncertainty-fail`
value adds that all-data gate and is recorded in the receipt:

```sh
openmc2donjon check mgxs_library.h5 \
  --production \
  --uncertainty-fail <model-specific-relative-limit>
```

OpenMC-side SPH workflows should apply the same policy before writing the final
sidecar or corrected HDF5. Exporter-synthesized zero fission placeholders in
non-fissionable mixtures are excluded from the expected coverage count.

## Optional OpenMC CE Reference-Flux Uncertainty

OpenMC-side SPH compares a heterogeneous OpenMC CE reference flux against a
homogenized OpenMC MG coarse flux. The geometries differ, so both arrays must
be projected onto the same declared comparison-domain ordering using a
complete, non-overlapping, conservative fine-to-coarse map. Energy groups,
physical state, and boundary conditions must also agree. When the CE reference
flux is stored in an HDF5 dataset, it may carry a sibling standard-deviation
dataset:

```text
/openmc_volume_flux
/openmc_volume_flux_std_dev
```

For case-specific names, the same convention applies:

```text
/my_reference_flux
/my_reference_flux_std_dev
```

The standard-deviation dataset must have the same shape as the mean reference
flux, finite non-negative values, and the same mixture/group ordering. The
recommended attributes mirror the mean dataset:

```text
attrs:
  mixture_names = [...]
  group_order = "mgxs_donjon"
  std_dev_of = "openmc_volume_flux"
```

`make-openmc-sph-sidecar` detects `<dataset>_std_dev` when either the CE
reference flux or the OpenMC MG macro flux source is HDF5, validates it, and
preserves the dataset names plus max relative standard deviations in the SPH
derivation record. A workflow-specific gate can then enforce:

```json
{
  "acceptance": {
    "require_reference_flux_std_dev": true,
    "max_reference_flux_std_dev_rel": 0.01,
    "require_mg_flux_std_dev": true,
    "max_mg_flux_std_dev_rel": 0.01
  }
}
```

This gate is separate from MGXS `*_std_dev` coverage: MGXS uncertainty belongs
to cross-section means, while CE/MG flux uncertainty belongs to the OpenMC flux
comparison used by the SPH update.

## Optional SPH Payload

SPH equivalence factors are stored as one positive vector per mixture:

```text
/mixtures/<domain_name>/sph  shape=(G,)
```

All calculations must either provide SPH or omit it. When present, the root
`L_MACROLIB` writer emits one `NSPH` record per energy-group directory and sets
the macrolib `STATE-VECTOR(14)` flag. The MULTICOMPO writer also carries the
per-mixture `NSPH` vector inside the calculation payload.

The converter does not apply SPH factors to cross sections. It carries the
factors and provenance metadata so a DONJON/DRAGON workflow that expects SPH
can consume them, or so an upstream equivalence step can mark that the XS were
already corrected with `sph_applied=true`.

**DONJON consumption routes (verified 2026-07-10).** Donjon's `NCR:` module
contains no SPH handling: `NSPH` records inside a `L_MULTICOMPO` are inert
archive metadata and are silently ignored on `NCR:` read (confirmed against
the DONJON 5.1 sources and numerically — an NSPH-carrying multicompo
reproduces the uncorrected k bit-for-bit while the pre-applied library
shifts it). The two working routes for making SPH factors take effect are:

1. the root `L_MACROLIB` output, whose `GROUP/*/NSPH` records are read by
   `DSPH:` and applied by `MAC:`; or
2. `openmc2donjon apply-sph`, which folds the factors into the cross
   sections before conversion, after which either output format works
   with any consumer.

A compact sidecar layout can be injected:

```text
/sph                 shape=(M, G)
  attrs: mixture_names
```

Example:

```sh
openmc2donjon make-sph-sidecar mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o sph_sidecar.h5 \
  --value 1.0

openmc2donjon make-sph-sidecar mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o sph_from_macrolib.h5 \
  --mode macrolib \
  --macrolib donor.macrolib.txt

openmc2donjon augment-sph mgxs_library.h5 \
  --sph-source sph_sidecar.h5 \
  -o mgxs_with_sph.h5

openmc2donjon check mgxs_with_sph.h5 --require-sph
```

This example demonstrates payload carriage only. The standard physical route
iterates `apply-sph --input-format openmc-mgxs`, applies the converged factors
to the Converter-facing HDF5, and then converts with
`--require-physical-sph`.

## Experimental Multi-State Burnup Axis

The production validation line is still one state point by default. The
converter also has experimental plumbing for one global `BURN` axis, using this
layout:

```text
/state_points/BURN                       shape=(S,)
/mixtures/<domain_name>/states/00000001/
    total
    absorption
    nu_fission
    chi
    scatter_matrix
/mixtures/<domain_name>/states/00000002/
    ...
```

Root datasets named `/burnup_values` or `/burnup`, or matching root
attributes, are also accepted as the burnup axis. All mixtures must contain the
same number of states, and the burnup axis length must match that state count.
Only one burnup-axis definition may be present.

This is a one-parameter history path, not a general branch-library schema.
Additional `/state_points/*` axes such as `BORON`, `TEMP`, `COOLANT`, or control
state are rejected by both preflight and converter code. Add those only after the
MULTICOMPO `PARKEY/PARTYP/PARFMT/TREE` mapping has been extended and validated.

Mixture-level attributes such as `fissionable`, `scatter_axes`, and `volume`
are inherited by each state group unless overridden. State datasets use the
same required and optional fields as the one-state mixture schema.

When this layout is present, `openmc2donjon` writes `NPAR=1`, `PARKEY=BURN`,
`NVALUE=S`, one `CALCULATIONS` item per state, and a per-mixture `TREE` linking
calculation indexes to the burnup values. This path is unit-tested for
serialization, but it is not part of the accepted C5G7 physics validation yet.

The preflight validator checks this layout before conversion: all mixtures must
use the same state count, the `BURN` axis must exist for multi-state inputs, and
its length must match the state count. It also rejects unsupported branch axes
instead of silently ignoring them.

## Scatter Row-Balance Check

For production handoffs, the preflight validator can check the P0 removal
balance in every mixture and state. Let `balance_absorption` be `absorption` for
ordinary scattering or `reduced_absorption` for declared nu-weighted
scattering:

```text
residual[g] = total[g] - balance_absorption[g] - sum_to(scatter_P0[g, to])
relative[g] = abs(residual[g]) / max(abs(total[g]), 1e-30)
```

This catches common handoff mistakes such as mixing ordinary absorption with a
nu-weighted scatter matrix, omitting reduced absorption, transposing scattering
axes, or carrying too much Monte Carlo noise in low-statistics MGXS tallies.

Example:

```sh
openmc2donjon check mgxs_library.h5 \
  --scatter-row-balance-warn 1e-3 \
  --scatter-row-balance-fail 1e-2
```

The same options are available with `openmc2donjon ... --check` and
`openmc2donjon-from-openmc ... --check`. When enabled, the text report and
summary JSON include the maximum absolute and relative residual and the worst
mixture/group location.

## Optional ADF Payload

Assembly discontinuity factors are stored under each mixture:

```text
/mixtures/<domain_name>/adf/<face_name>  shape=(G,)
```

Typical Cartesian face names are:

```text
FD_XMIN
FD_XMAX
FD_YMIN
FD_YMAX
```

When ADF datasets are present, the MULTICOMPO writer emits the embedded
`MACROLIB/ADF` payload and sets the corresponding DONJON state-vector flags.

Computed ADF/DF values can also be injected from a sidecar HDF5:

```sh
openmc2donjon make-adf-sidecar mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o adf_sidecar.h5 \
  --mode unity

openmc2donjon augment-adf mgxs_library.h5 \
  --adf-source adf_sidecar.h5 \
  -o mgxs_with_adf.h5 \
  --faces FD_XMIN,FD_XMAX,FD_YMIN,FD_YMAX
```

`make-adf-sidecar --mode unity` writes a compact root `/adf` sidecar with
identity values and `adf_real=false`, useful for workflow checks before a real
ADF/DF post-processor supplies physical values.

For production ADF/DF generation, `make-adf-sidecar --mode flux-ratio` computes:

```text
ADF[mix, face, group] =
    heterogeneous_face_flux[mix, face, group]
  / homogeneous_face_flux[mix, face, group]
```

The two flux inputs may use explicit `FILE::/dataset/path` references or one of
the built-in dataset names:

```text
surface flux:          /surface_flux/mean
                       /heterogeneous_face_flux
                       /surface_flux_proxy

homogeneous face flux: /homogeneous_face_flux
                       /homogeneous/face_flux
```

Accepted array layouts are `(M, F, G)`, `(M, G, F)`, `(Y, X, G, F)`, or
`(Y, X, F, G)`. Three-dimensional arrays may use `mixture_names` and
`face_names` attributes. Four-dimensional mesh arrays must provide a
`mixture_names` mesh dataset or attribute so cells can be mapped back to MGXS
mixture names.

For OpenMC statepoints that contain a `MeshSurfaceFilter` + `MuSurfaceFilter`
current tally, `export-surface-flux` writes the supported surface-flux layout:

```sh
openmc2donjon export-surface-flux statepoint.120.h5 \
  --mgxs mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o openmc_surface_flux.h5 \
  --tally-name openmc2donjon_surface_current_mu \
  --mesh-shape 1,2 \
  --mu-edges 0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0 \
  --face-area 4.0
```

The exported HDF5 contains `/surface_flux/mean` with layout
`(mesh_y, mesh_x, group, face)` and a `/mixture_names` mesh mapping.

Low-order driver outputs can be canonicalized before the homogeneous
reconstruction step:

```sh
openmc2donjon make-low-order-driver mgxs_library.h5 \
  -o low_order_driver.h5 \
  --raw-driver raw_low_order_driver.h5 \
  --faces FD_XMIN,FD_XMAX,FD_YMIN,FD_YMAX
```

The command validates the external driver data against MGXS mixture/group
metadata and writes:

```text
/volume_flux          shape=(M, G)
/net_current_density  shape=(M, F, G), positive outward
/mixture_names
/face_names
```

The preferred production adapter input is a single raw-driver HDF5 bundle. A
minimal bundle exposes `/volume_flux` and `/net_current_density`. For
nonstandard dataset paths, set root attributes `volume_flux_dataset` and
`net_current_dataset`; `make-low-order-driver --raw-driver` will follow those
paths. The optional root `schema` attribute may be
`openmc2donjon.low-order-driver-raw.v1`, but unversioned raw files are accepted
as long as the required datasets and metadata are present.

Raw driver datasets may declare `mixture_names` and `face_names` attributes or
root datasets. `make-low-order-driver` uses those names to reorder mixture and
face axes into the requested canonical `--faces` order. If `face_names` are
absent, the raw net-current face axis is interpreted as already matching
`--faces`.

Raw net-current datasets may also declare a `sign_convention`,
`net_current_sign_convention`, or `current_sign_convention` attribute/root
dataset. Supported values are `positive outward` and `positive inward`.
`positive inward` is multiplied by `-1` during canonicalization so the written
`low_order_driver.h5` always uses `positive outward`. If no sign metadata is
present, use `--net-current-sign-convention positive-inward` to request the
same conversion explicitly.

Before using the driver as an ADF denominator source, run the strict contract
check:

```sh
openmc2donjon check-low-order-driver mgxs_library.h5 low_order_driver.h5 \
  --faces FD_XMIN,FD_XMAX,FD_YMIN,FD_YMAX \
  --face-widths 4.0
```

The check requires the canonical schema, matching MGXS energy/group/mixture
metadata, `net_current_density` sign convention `positive outward`, finite
currents, positive volume flux, and, when `--face-widths` is supplied, positive
reconstructed homogeneous face flux.

For a diffusion-current homogeneous denominator, `make-homogeneous-face-flux`
uses `D = 1/(3 * transport_total)` from the MGXS handoff and computes:

```text
phi_face[mix, face, group] =
    phi_avg[mix, group]
  - J_out[mix, face, group] * face_width[face] / (2D[mix, group])
```

It reads volume flux datasets named `/volume_flux/average`, `/volume_flux`,
`/scalar_flux`, or `/flux`, and net outward current datasets named
`/net_current_density`, `/net_current`, `/boundary_currents/net`, or
`/current_density`. Explicit `FILE::/dataset/path` references are also
accepted. The output is `/homogeneous_face_flux` with layout `(M, F, G)`.

Before making the final ADF sidecar, `check-face-flux` validates the numerator
and denominator handoff together:

```sh
openmc2donjon check-face-flux mgxs_library.h5 \
  --surface-flux openmc_surface_flux.h5 \
  --homogeneous-face-flux homogeneous_face_flux.h5 \
  --faces FD_XMIN,FD_XMAX,FD_YMIN,FD_YMAX \
  --summary-json face_flux_check_summary.json
```

The check requires matching MGXS mixture/group metadata, matching face names,
positive finite heterogeneous and homogeneous fluxes, and a positive finite
ratio. If invalid ratio bins are expected, they must be acknowledged with an
explicit `--invalid-fill` policy; the JSON summary records the invalid and
filled bin counts plus the same clip bounds used by sidecar generation.

For the direct external homogeneous-face-flux denominator contract and adapter
pattern, see `docs/EXTERNAL_FACE_FLUX_CONTRACT.md`.

The sidecar can either reuse the normal MGXS layout with
`/mixtures/<domain_name>/adf`, or provide a compact root dataset:

```text
/adf                              shape=(M, F, G)
  attrs:
    mixture_names = [name_1, ..., name_M]
    face_names    = [face_1, ..., face_F]
```

The augment step requires every input mixture to have the same positive,
finite ADF faces and writes the standard per-mixture `/adf/<face_name>` layout.

## Scattering Convention

The dense scatter matrix is interpreted as:

```text
scatter_matrix[moment, from_group, to_group]
```

If the HDF5 stores OpenMC-style `(G_in, G_out, L + 1)`, the reader normalizes it
internally before writing.

The values are bare Legendre moments. `openmc2donjon` writes DRAGON/DONJON
`NJJS/IJJS/SCAT` triplets with contiguous incoming-group spans and descending
incoming-group order.

## Minimal Tree

```text
/attrs:
    energy_groups = G
    legendre_order = L
/energy_bounds
/mixtures/ASM_Y01_X01/
    total
    absorption
    nu_fission
    chi
    scatter_matrix
    transport_total          optional
    volume                   optional
    /adf/FD_XMIN             optional
    /adf/FD_XMAX             optional
    /adf/FD_YMIN             optional
    /adf/FD_YMAX             optional
/mixtures/ASM_Y01_X02/
    ...
```

Experimental burnup-axis variant:

```text
/attrs:
    energy_groups = G
    legendre_order = L
/energy_bounds
/state_points/BURN
/mixtures/ASM_Y01_X01/
    attrs: fissionable, scatter_axes, volume
    /states/00000001/
        total
        absorption
        nu_fission
        chi
        scatter_matrix
    /states/00000002/
        ...
```

## Preflight Checks

The packaged CLI can inspect the handoff inventory without converting:

```sh
openmc2donjon inspect mgxs_library.h5
```

`inspect` lists root attributes, energy groups, mixture names, state counts,
optional dataset coverage, scatter-axis metadata, ADF faces, and can write
`--summary-json` for automation.

To compare a regenerated handoff with a locked baseline:

```sh
openmc2donjon diff accepted_mgxs.h5 candidate_mgxs.h5
```

`diff` compares the HDF5 object tree, dataset shapes/dtypes/values, and
attributes. Numeric comparison is exact by default; pass `--rtol` and `--atol`
when a tolerance is intended. Use `--ignore-attrs` or repeated `--ignore-attr`
for provenance metadata that is expected to differ.

The packaged CLI can also enforce the contract before writing:

```sh
openmc2donjon check mgxs_library.h5
```

The same preflight can be attached to conversion:

```sh
openmc2donjon mgxs_library.h5 -o out.mcompo.txt --check
```

The legacy helper wrapper still combines preflight and conversion for the
accepted C5G7 handoff checks:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python examples/donjon_openmc2donjon/convert_mgxs_with_preflight.py \
  examples/donjon_openmc2donjon/c5g7_assembly_p1_adf_production.h5 \
  --require-transport-dataset \
  --require-volume \
  --require-adf \
  --expected-adf-faces FD_XMIN,FD_XMAX,FD_YMIN,FD_YMAX \
  -o /private/tmp/c5g7pa.mco
```

For experimental multi-state files, the same preflight path reports the detected
state count and `BURN` axis:

```sh
openmc2donjon check /path/to/multistate_mgxs.h5
```
