# Architecture

`openmc2donjon` is intentionally small. It translates a compact OpenMC MGXS HDF5
handoff file into DRAGON/DONJON LCM ASCII without linking against DRAGON/PyGan.

## Data Flow

```text
OpenMC MGXS domains
  -> exporter or user-written HDF5 input contract
  -> openmc2donjon CLI
  -> L_MULTICOMPO or L_MACROLIB
  -> DONJON geometry mixture map
```

The domain mapping is spatial:

```text
one OpenMC MGXS domain -> one cross-section set -> one DONJON mixture
```

Converter is the mandatory boundary for every formal handoff. Optional
physical SPH runs upstream of that final conversion:

```text
heterogeneous OpenMC CE fine reference
  -> conservative comparison-domain collapse
  -> homogenized OpenMC MG coarse solve
  -> rate-preserving SPH iteration
  -> corrected MGXS HDF5 with sph_applied=true
  -> Converter -> L_MULTICOMPO or L_MACROLIB + receipt
```

The fine and coarse geometries are not identical. They share energy groups,
physical state and boundary conditions, and a complete non-overlapping map that
preserves each comparison domain's volume and integrated reference rates.
It preserves the integrated reference flux as well as the reaction rates.
Native DRAGON `SPH:` is available only as an advanced external-solver project
route: Converter writes its uncorrected reference object first, and the external
installation owns the numerical iteration.

## Output Modes

`L_MULTICOMPO` is the default path for spatially mapped homogenized data. It is
the main route for assembly-wise C5G7.

`L_MACROLIB` is available for direct DONJON consumption when a full MULTICOMPO
container is unnecessary or too heavy for a given one-state solve.

## State And Parameter Scope

The current production scope is one state point by default:

```text
NPAR = 0
NLOC = 0
single calculation per spatial domain
```

Single-point helper metadata such as `BURN` can be written for compatibility
checks. The converter can also serialize an experimental one-parameter burnup
history:

```text
NPAR = 1
PARKEY = BURN
one CALCULATIONS item per burnup state
```

That path is covered by unit tests and by a tiny DONJON `NCR:` consumer smoke,
but it is not part of the accepted physics validation.

The history path is intentionally one-dimensional for now. Inputs with
additional `/state_points/*` branch axes are rejected so boron, temperature,
control, or other branch coordinates cannot be silently dropped.

## Important Conventions

- OpenMC group-index order is preserved for cross-section arrays.
- `ENERGY` is written as reversed HDF5 energy bounds.
- Scatter triplets use contiguous incoming-group spans in descending incoming
  group order.
- Legendre scattering values are bare moments.
- `STRD` comes from explicit `transport_total` whenever P1+ scattering is
  present. With P0-only scattering it may fall back to `NTOT0`; Converter does
  not reconstruct OpenMC `TransportXS` from a bare P1 row sum.
- ADF payloads are optional per-mixture datasets under `/mixtures/<name>/adf/`.
